                <h2>More "Stranger Things" To Come</h2>
                <section>
                    <h4>9 OCT, BY PAUL BADER</h4>
                    <p>Dear readers, we are excited to introduce you to the main recommendation of this month of our magazine, the second season of the much-anticipated horror-thriller series, “Stranger Things”, created by Matt & Ross Duffer in association with Netflix. As we remember, the first season finale concluded with the return of Will Byers and the heroic death (or what only seems to have been a death, according to the new trailer YAY!) of the supernatural character, Eleven. She sacrifices herself to defeat the dark force that was threatening to turn the small, quiet town of Hawkins upside down. Everything seems to have come to an end, until the last scene of the season debuts, in which a maggot monster crawls out of Will’s mouth. The citizens of the sleepy town have no idea that before the disappearance of the terrifying monster, new descendants were created or what awaits them in the year to come. Now, that all the main events of the last episode are fresh in our minds, let’s take a look on what we know so far about the most expected TV release of this month.</p><br>

                    <h5>1. Cover</h5>
                    <p>We have been introduced to the cover of the new season long before any other solid information was publicly announced, and it was everything we expected. A force even more evil and powerful has the little town as target and things are not going to stop getting stranger around there.</p><br>
                    <img src="assets/stranger.jpg" alt="Strager Things Season 2 Cover" width="80" id="cover">
                    <br>
                    <h5>2. Posters</h5>
                    <p>The official social media pages of both, Netflix and the series itself, have released a number of similar, 80’s-typical-looking theme we were introduced to since the beginning of the series, alongside the second season tagline “It only gets stranger…”. Besides the visual message, which expresses the feeling of unsettlement and fear, enhanced by the crimson light also seen on the season’s official cover; there were added a series of random descriptions. But at a closer look, there can be found some sort of connection, because placed together they create a short story: “We’re going back to Hawkins. A place where the curiosity door never closes. A place where new adventures await us. And it’s only getting stranger.”</p>

                    <br>

                    <h5>3. Brand new trailer</h5>
                    <p>The official trailer gives us a little sneak peak of what is there to come in the new season:<br> - Eleven is back, but not really<br> - no one knows if she is coming back in our world or if she’s trapped in the other dimension, the monster came from; <br> - the chronological time advances and takes us to year 1984 – the time of the well-known “Ghostbuster” phenomena, which adds more tension to the creepy feeling already existing;<br> - although there is a time gap, Will does not seem to be really as before. The scene where he is tied up to a testing chair might be interpreted in different ways: either people find out about the whole monster story and think he suffers from sort of mental disorder or he could be in more trouble, since he was the host for the most-possibly new monster. OUCH!;<br> - the new monster is bigger, darker and even more terrifying. </p>

                <h2>Movie vs. Book</h2>
                <section>
                    <h4>12 OCT, BY PAUL BADER</h4>
                    <img src="assets/gone.jpg" alt="Gone With The Wind Poster" id="gone">
                    <p>In this edition of our “Movie vs. Book” we are analyzing a classic, the one and only “Gone With The Wind”, a world-wide-known masterpiece created by Margaret Mitchell. The release of the much-debated novel debuted in year 1936, having as the main protagonist the anti-model Scarlett O’Hara, a very complex and unique character. The movie adapted to the original creation was also a global success, when it hit the theaters, in 1939, and later on, it’s originality was rewarded, becoming the first film to receive eight regular Academy Awards and two special Oscars, record that stood for 20 years in addition to smashing the time’s Box Office, with $390,525,192 worth worldwide.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Both, the movie and the book follow mostly the same plot, where events take place during the American Civil War, which splits the country into two. The battles between the southerners, and the northerners, nicknamed “the yankees”, place the action in a well-defined spot on the mankind’s time map, which contributes to the authenticity of the creation. It also brings out specific traits of the main character, that are most of the time in contradiction with the time’s social principles, such as vanity and seductiveness. These details alongside with behavior and insights from Scarlett’s emotions and thoughts make it very clear for the public from the very start that she is the atypical kind of protagonist. She is shameless, has every man’s attention, comes from a wealthy family and, long story short she is a spoiled brat. As the action progresses, the spotlight is pointed towards the teenager’s love life, which becomes the main subject of both, the movie and the novel. Initially, no one would like this character, but after spending some time in the creation’s universe, the reader or the viewer slowly starts to connect and relate to different aspects of Scarlett’s point of view or actions, that determines reflection and self meditation. What Scarlett can not accept is the feeling of rejection, having her childhood crush, Ashley Wilkes, turning her down. This childish thought escalates really fast into an obsession, fed by selfishness and ego-centered desires. Although, she falls in love with Rhett Butler and eventually marries him, Scarlett is driven still by the picture created in her mind and tries to have it all, only to lose it all in the end. When she realizes Ashely is in reality not who she has fallen in love with as a young teenager, being a fully grown-up woman at this time, she also loses her true love, her husband, Rhett, who can no longer accept to take the second place in her heart.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The book manages to incorporate the reader inside the fictional world with countless thorough details, while the movie is recognized for the stunning shots, multiple special effects and the overall revolutionary approach for that time of the cinematography industry. So, our verdict is: a tie! Considering both, the movie and the book, are all-time classics, there is nothing else we can add.</p>

                <h2>Interview With Daisy Ridley</h2>
                <section>
                    <h4>14 OCT, BY PAUL BADER</h4>
                    <img src="assets/interview.jpg" alt="Photo of Daisy Ridley" width="100" id="ridley">
                    <br>
                    <div class="newspaper">
                        <p>During my last trip to New York I got the chance to talk to the one and only, Daisy Ridley, the freshly new star of Hollywood and the lead character of the two, latest Star Wars movies. Daisy Ridley was born on 10 April 1992, in Westminster, London. She is the youngest of three daughters born to Louise Fawkner-Corbett and Chris Ridley. Her great-uncle was “Dad's Army” actor and playwright Arnold Ridley. When she was growing up, her favourite film was Matilda (1996), an adaptation of Roald Dahl's children's story, with the title character (played by Mara Wilson in the film) a role model to her. Ridley won a scholarship to Tring Park School for the Performing Arts in Hertfordshire, which she attended between the ages of 9 and 18. She then began reading classical civilisation at Birkbeck, University of London, before dropping out to concentrate on her acting career.</p>
                        <p>
                            <br><b>PAUL BADER:</b> Hello! It is nice to meet you! <br>DAISY RIDLEY: Hi! It’s nice to meet you too! <br>BADER: So, for the beginning, can we talk a little about your breakout role, in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”?
                            <br>RIDLEY: Sure! Umm… There was this rumor that a revival of the franchise was going to go in production, earlier in 2013 and of course, as a fan I got really excited. But it wasn’t until the beginning of the next year that I heard anyone could audition for the leading role, which was intriguing, but surely not enough reasons for me to actually do it. You might not believe it now, but sometimes I tend to be the shy-in-the-back-of-the-class kind of girl. Thankfully, I had my mother that really believed in me and actually convinced me to give it a shot. And I took the part!
                            <br>BADER: What can you tell us about your childhood? What impact do you think it has on the life you are living now? On your career?
                            <br>RIDLEY: Well, there is my mom, who is my protector and number one supporter, my dad and I also have a few sisters. Hm, the way my childhood influenced my present life? I guess I’ve always loved arts, especially cinematography. My family already had quite a background related to the movie industry, so it’s like it is in my veins, you know? As for my character, I could say I wasn’t really confident during my childhood and teenage years. I was more of the opposite, since I am an introvert. I really hated it at that time, because you know, I was not one of the cool kids, I didn’t throw wild parties while my parents were away and had a pretty hard time fitting in. I tended to be on my own most of the times and I was really hard on myself, always wanting to do something perfectly. I believe that is the road to any success in life: ambition and perfection. <br>BADER: What was the biggest inconvenience you had while filming the seventh episode of “Star Wars”?
                            <br>RIDLEY: I get really emotional. And there was this time while we were filming that it all came to me. It was like the moment I realized how huge this was and how privileged I got to feel for being a part of it. But my character, Ray, wasn’t supposed to cry in that scene, so yeah…
                            <br>BADER: How was it to work with such great people of the movie industry?
                            <br>RIDLEY: It was very… professional! There was not a moment I doubted any of the elements involved in the whole process of creating this movie. And besides working with the best, I also worked with really warm and kind and nice people. I was expecting to feel kind of the newbie on the set, but it wasn’t the case.
                            <br>BADER: Finally, are there any details about the upcoming movie you could share with us? <br>RIDLEY: As much as I would like to, I can not share any other details than the teaser reveals. But I can tell you a little about how I felt while filming. Even though I am not part of the original, filming the last scenes was very nostalgic. It felt more than just the ending of a franchise, it felt like the end of a chapter, of an era. And there are no words to describe how glad I am I got the chance to be a part of such an iconic production. All I can say is that the ending is an unexpected one. It’s what the writers wanted. 
                            <br>BADER: Thank you so much for answering my questions!
                            <br>RIDLEY: The pleasure was mine.</p>
